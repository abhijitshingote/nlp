    "Defining text length is quite obvious: it’s how long your text is. But, why does it matter? Well, you have a higher chance of ranking in Google if you write long, high-quality blog posts, of 1000 words or more. We’ve also experienced this ourselves; we have written quite some articles that are over 2500 words. They are cornerstone content and they help our organic traffic grow. Here’s how long articles contribute to SEO:\n",
    "\n",
    "When your text is longer, Google has more clues to determine what it is about. The longer your (optimized) text, the more often your focus keyphrase appears. This is no excuse for keyphrase stuffing though! If you optimize your copy naturally, your focus keyphrase will pop up here and there throughout your text. You can also fit in more synonyms and related keyphrases. In a longer post, you can add more headings, links, and images, in which you can also mention the keyphrase. So more content, means more on-topic, high-quality information here.\n",
    "\n",
    "A longer text might also help you rank for multiple long-tail variants of the keyphrase you’ve optimized your text for. That’s because, in a lengthy text, you probably address various topics. Your article, or your other posts that take a deep-dive into the subtopic, will have a chance to turn up in search results for the long-tail variants of your keyphrase. If you do some smart internal linking you can even boost the traffic to the extensive post you’ve written. This will help you drive more organic traffic to your site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, if a page consists of few words, Google is more likely to think of it as thin content. All search engines want to provide the best answers to the queries people have.
